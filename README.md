## Triangle Sports Analytics 2026 🏀

Repository for my submission to the Triangle Sports Analytics
college basketball modeling competition.

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting college basketball point
spreads and constructing calibrated outcome prediction intervals
under competition constraints.

### Approach
- Trained regression-based models on historical game data
- Incorporated market information (closing spreads) for
  calibration and sanity checks
- Evaluated performance using mean absolute error (MAE)
  and prediction interval coverage
